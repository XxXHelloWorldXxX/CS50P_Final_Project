Tic Tac Toe

Description:
My reason for coding this Tic Tac Toe game was, that I thought that it could be a little challenging but not too much, so that I can show it to my friend (Who just started learning python) and explain to him how it works.

I already at the start decided, that I wanted a one player and two player. I first did the two player part and then went over to the one player. Creating the bot was defenitly the more challenging part. At first I thought of just taking all of the free spaces each turn and just letting the random.choice decide one of the squares, but that would've made the bot utterly terrible and so I created my first own little bot.

After I was "done" with the bot and started a match with him, I actually lost the first round. This not only made me realise that I'm really bad at Tic Tac Toe but also that I want to really start doing some machine learning.

Overall this was a pretty fun project to do. 
I'm very thankfull to the CS50 team for putting together all of these awesome courses (I did the CS50 course prior and plan to do the other ones too).

This was my CS50P final project.
